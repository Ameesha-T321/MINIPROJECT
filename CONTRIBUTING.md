We welcome contributions from everyone! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, suggesting enhancements, or adding new features, there are plenty of ways to help.

### Steps to Get Started

1. Fork the Repository 
   Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This will allow you to freely make changes without affecting the original codebase.

2. Clone Your Fork  
   Clone the repository to your local machine to start working:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MINIPROJECT.git
   ```

3. Create a New Branch 
   It's important to create a separate branch for your changes. This keeps the main branch clean and makes it easier to merge:

   Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

7. Create a Pull Request  
   Navigate to the original repository and open a pull request (PR). Make sure to include a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.

## Tomato Plant Disease Detection 🌿🍅

### Introduction  
Tomato plants are highly susceptible to various diseases that can significantly reduce crop yield and quality. Early and accurate disease detection is crucial to preventing crop failure, minimizing economic losses, and ensuring food security. Traditional methods of disease diagnosis are often time-consuming, require expert knowledge, and may lead to misdiagnosis.  

This project leverages Deep Learning and Computer Vision to build an automated tomato leaf disease detection system. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of tomato leaf images, this model can classify different types of tomato diseases with high accuracy. To make the solution accessible and easy to use, a Streamlit-based web application is developed, allowing users to upload images of tomato leaves and receive instant predictions.  

### Features 
✅ Deep learning-based CNN model for disease classification  
✅ Trained on Tomato Leaf Dataset from Kaggle  
✅ Streamlit web app for user-friendly interaction  
✅ Supports multiple tomato diseases classification  
✅ Data Augmentation to improve model generalization  
✅ Model evaluation with accuracy visualization
